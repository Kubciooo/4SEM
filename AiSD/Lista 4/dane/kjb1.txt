insert he

insert and
insert he

insert LORD
insert wilt
insert thou

insert 
insert Said
insert he

insert She

insert she
insert herself
insert said
insert He
insert is
insert my

insert in
insert the

insert of
insert my
insert heart
insert and
insert innocency
insert of
insert my

insert have
insert I
insert done
insert this
insert 
insert And
insert God
insert said
insert unto
insert him
insert in
insert a
insert dream
insert Yea
insert I
insert know
insert that
insert thou
insert didst
insert this

insert for
insert I

insert therefore
insert suffered
insert I
insert thee

insert 
insert Now
insert therefore
insert restore
insert the
insert man
insert his

insert for
insert he

insert that
insert thou

insert thou
insert and

insert 
insert Therefore
insert Abimelech
insert rose

insert and

insert 
insert Then
insert Abimelech

insert unto
insert him
insert What

insert thou

insert that

insert 
insert And
insert Abimelech

insert unto
insert Abraham
insert What
insert sawest
insert thou
insert that
insert thou
insert hast
insert done
insert this
insert thing
insert 
insert And
insert Abraham
insert said
insert Because
insert I
insert thought
insert Surely
insert the

insert of
insert God
insert is
insert not

insert this

insert and
insert they

insert she

insert

insert it

insert when
insert God

insert them
insert unto

insert 
insert And
insert Abimelech

insert What

insert thou

insert 
insert It
insert is
insert in
insert the

insert wherefore

insert thou
insert stolen
insert my

insert 
insert And
insert Jacob
insert answered
insert and
insert said
insert to
insert Laban
insert Because
insert I
insert was

insert for
insert I
insert said
insert Peradventure
insert thou

insert thy

insert 
insert With

insert thou

insert thou
insert what

insert For
insert Jacob
insert knew
insert not
insert that
insert Rachel
insert had

insert them
insert 
insert And
insert Laban
insert went
insert into
insert Jacob's

insert and

insert and
insert into
insert the

insert he

insert 
insert And
insert Jacob

insert Laban
insert and
insert Jacob

insert and
insert said
insert to
insert Laban
insert What
insert is
insert my

insert what

insert my

insert that

insert the

insert And
insert Pharaoh

insert and

insert it

insert 
insert And
insert it
insert came
insert to

insert in
insert the

insert that

insert 
insert Then

insert unto

insert this

insert 
insert Pharaoh

insert with

insert 
insert And
insert there
insert was
insert there
insert with
insert us
insert a
insert young
insert man
insert an
insert Hebrew
insert servant
insert to
insert the
insert captain
insert of
insert the

insert and
insert we

insert him
insert and
insert he

insert to

insert our

insert to

insert me
insert he

insert 
insert Then
insert Pharaoh

insert Joseph
insert and
insert they

insert Pharaoh
insert

insert unto
insert Joseph
insert I

insert a

insert and
insert there

insert thee
insert that
insert thou

insert a

insert 
insert And
insert Joseph

insert It

insert not

insert me
insert God
insert shall
insert give
insert Pharaoh
insert an

insert 
insert And
insert Pharaoh

insert In
insert my

insert behold
insert I
insert stood
insert upon
insert the

insert and

insert such
insert as
insert I
insert never

insert in
insert all
insert the
insert land
insert of
insert Egypt
insert for
insert badness
insert 
insert And
insert the
insert lean
insert and
insert the
insert ill

insert kine
insert did
insert eat
insert up
insert the

insert seven

insert 
insert And
insert when

insert them

insert it

insert So
insert I

insert 
insert And
insert the

insert the

insert but
insert there
insert was
insert none
insert that

insert it
insert to

insert 
insert And
insert Joseph
insert said
insert unto
insert Pharaoh
insert The

insert of
insert Pharaoh
insert is
insert one
insert God
insert hath

insert Pharaoh
insert what

insert 
insert The

insert the

insert 
insert And
insert the

insert kine
insert that

insert and
insert the

insert shall
insert be
insert seven
insert years
insert of

insert 
insert This
insert is
insert the
insert thing
insert which

insert unto
insert Pharaoh
insert What
insert God
insert is

insert he

insert unto
insert Pharaoh
insert 
insert Behold
insert there
insert come
insert seven

insert of

insert throughout
insert all
insert the

insert of
insert Egypt
insert 
insert And
insert there
insert shall
insert arise
insert after
insert them
insert seven
insert years
insert of
insert famine
insert and
insert all
insert the
insert plenty
insert shall
insert be

insert in
insert the
insert land
insert of
insert Egypt
insert and
insert the

insert shall
insert consume
insert the

insert 
insert And
insert the

insert shall

insert that

insert 
insert And
insert for
insert that
insert the

insert it
insert is
insert because
insert the

insert and

insert 
insert Now

insert 
insert Let

insert 
insert And
insert the

insert were

insert and

insert and

insert and
insert the

insert them
insert 
insert Now
insert there
insert arose

insert a
insert new

insert the

insert them
insert lest
insert they

insert that
insert when
insert there
insert falleth
insert out
insert any

insert they

insert against
insert us
insert and
insert so
insert get
insert them
insert up
insert out
insert of
insert the
insert land
insert 
insert Therefore
insert they
insert did
insert set
insert over
insert them
insert taskmasters
insert to
insert afflict
insert them
insert with
insert their

insert 
insert But
insert the

insert they

insert them
insert the
insert more
insert they
insert multiplied
insert and

insert And
insert they
insert were
insert grieved
insert because
insert of
insert the

insert of
insert Israel
insert 
insert And
insert the
insert Egyptians
insert made
insert the
insert children
insert of
insert Israel
insert to

insert 
insert And
insert they

insert in

insert and
insert in
insert brick
insert and

insert in
insert the

insert all
insert their

insert wherein
insert they

insert them
insert serve
insert was
insert with
insert rigour
insert 
insert And
insert the
insert king
insert of
insert Egypt
insert spake
insert to
insert the
insert Hebrew
insert midwives
insert of
insert which
insert the
insert name
insert of
insert the
insert one
insert was
insert Shiphrah
insert and
insert the
insert name
insert of
insert the
insert other
insert Puah
insert 
insert And
insert he
insert said
insert When
insert ye
insert do
insert the
insert office
insert of
insert a
insert midwife
insert to
insert the
insert Hebrew
insert women
insert and
insert see
insert them
insert upon
insert the

insert if
insert it

insert a
insert son
insert then
insert ye
insert shall
insert kill
insert him
insert but
insert if
insert it
insert be
insert a

insert then
insert she
insert shall
insert live
insert 
insert But
insert the
insert midwives
insert feared
insert God
insert and
insert did
insert not
insert as
insert the
insert king
insert of
insert Egypt
insert commanded
insert them
insert but
insert saved
insert the
insert men
insert children
insert alive
insert 
insert And
insert the
insert king
insert of
insert Egypt
insert called
insert for
insert the
insert midwives
insert and
insert said
insert unto
insert them
insert Why
insert have
insert ye
insert done
insert this
insert thing
insert and
insert have
insert saved
insert the
insert men
insert children
insert alive
insert 
insert And
insert the
insert midwives
insert said
insert unto
insert Pharaoh
insert Because
insert the
insert Hebrew
insert women
insert are
insert not
insert as
insert the
insert Egyptian
insert women
insert for
insert they
insert are
insert lively
insert and
insert are
insert delivered
insert ere
insert the
insert midwives
insert come
insert in
insert unto
insert them
insert 
insert Therefore
insert God
insert dealt
insert well
insert with
insert the
insert midwives
insert and
insert the
insert people
insert multiplied
insert and
insert waxed
insert very
insert mighty
insert 
insert And
insert it
insert came
insert to
insert pass
insert because
insert the
insert midwives
insert feared
insert God
insert that
insert he
insert made
insert them
insert houses
insert 
insert And
insert Pharaoh
insert charged
insert all
insert his

insert 
insert And
insert there
insert went
insert a
insert man
insert of
insert the

insert of
insert Levi
insert and

insert 
insert And

insert that

insert she

insert him
insert she

insert him
insert an

insert she

insert

insert it
insert she

insert the

insert And
insert Moses

insert and

insert Surely
insert this

insert 
insert Now
insert when
insert Pharaoh

insert this

insert he

insert Moses
insert But
insert Moses
insert fled

insert 
insert And
insert when

insert he

insert it
insert that

insert drew
insert water
insert enough
insert for

insert and

insert the

insert 
insert And
insert he
insert said
insert unto
insert his

insert And
insert where
insert is
insert he
insert why
insert is
insert it
insert that
insert ye

insert I

insert 
insert And
insert it

insert that
insert the

insert and
insert the

insert sighed
insert by

insert and
insert they

insert and
insert their

insert came
insert up
insert unto
insert God
insert by
insert reason
insert of
insert the

insert 
insert And
insert God

insert and
insert God
insert remembered
insert his

insert 
insert Now
